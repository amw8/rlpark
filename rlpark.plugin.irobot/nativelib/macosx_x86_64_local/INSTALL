AFTER INSTALLATION VERY IMPORTANT
        check existence of the folder /var/spool/uucp
        if you don't have it create it with command
        sudo mkdir /var/spool/uucp
        permissions should be: drwxrwxr-x
        if they are not do command
        sudo chmod 775 /var/spool/uucp

        YOU should be a member of the uucp group
        you can check it with command
                niutil -readprop / /groups/uucp users
        you should see your name in output of the niutil command
        if you don't do following:
                sudo niutil -appendprop / /groups/uucp users <yourname>
                        substitute  <yourname> with your user's name
                        for example if your user name is peter:
                                sudo niutil -appendprop / /groups/uucp users peter
